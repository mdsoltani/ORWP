Orientation-based Random Waypoint Mobility Model

In the context of optical wireless communications (as well as millimeter wave and terahertz systems), it is indeed important to consider the random orientation of the user device. At such small wavelengths, the user equipment's random orientation can affect the angle of arrival or incidence angle that leads to a change in channel gain as well as the received signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, it can result in frequent handovers that may influence user's quality of experience. Hence, it is required to consider the random orientation of the user equipment in our analysis to obtain more realistic results. 
Therefore, a framework that combines the conventional mobility models with the random orientation model is required.
In this codes, we propose an extended orientation-based random waypoint mobility model, in which the random orientation of the user eqiopment is considered during both walking and pause time.
